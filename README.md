# Psychic Blade

## Overview

Psychic Blade is a top down dungeon crawler demo where you play a psychic adventurer who rotates a blade around their body to slay enemies and solve puzzles they encounter in their journey.

Currently the game is only a basic demo of the rotational blade mechanic with some simple levels to test the functionality but I may eventually add more enemies and levels to the game.

I highly recommend first time players play the **Tutorial** level and after that try the **Slime Spawners** level to see how long they can last and how high of a combo they can get!
